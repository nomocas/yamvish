# Yamvish

Yet another javascript MVish-not-a-framework library.
 
- really really fast
- really small (+- 4Ko minified/gzipped)
- nodejs or browser agnostic (aka real isomorphism)
- based on virtual DOM and/or usable directly on real DOMElements.
- could output to DOMElement or to String.
- even if it's really fast in the browser with DOMElement handling, rendering is 9 times faster under nodejs when using pure string output.
- based on ObservableMap for data-binding
- high modularity
- clean code, easy to understand and to masterize.
